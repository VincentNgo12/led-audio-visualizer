## üöÄ Features

- **Real-Time Audio Processing:** Captures audio via analog microphone (MAX4466/MAX9814).
- **FFT Spectrum Analysis:** Uses CMSIS DSP library for fast Fourier transform to analyze audio frequencies.
- **Dynamic LED Effects:** Maps frequency bands to colorful LED bars with smooth animations and peak-hold effects.
- **DMA & Interrupt Driven:** Efficient data acquisition and LED updates using DMA and hardware interrupts.
- **Customizable:** Easily adjust number of LEDs, bars, and color schemes.

## üìù How It Works

1. **Audio Capture:**  
   The microcontroller samples audio from a microphone using ADC (analog).
2. **FFT Analysis:**  
   The sampled audio is processed with a fast Fourier transform to extract frequency information.
3. **LED Mapping:**  
   Frequency bands are mapped to LED bars, with color and brightness reflecting the audio spectrum.
4. **Real-Time Display:**  
   LEDs are updated in real-time using DMA-driven PWM for smooth, flicker-free visuals.
